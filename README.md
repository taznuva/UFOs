# UFOs

## Overview of Project
### Purpose 
  This project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time thru JavaScript. 

## Results
  One can use the search criteria by a number of ways. First, you can filter by date. 
  Then by city and state to be more specific. 
  You can also filter by city, state, and shape. 
## Summary
  One drawback for this new design is that it doesn't filter thru specific topics. For future improvements, I recommend on adding another filter for specific topics or comments. Another would be adding more sources such as videos for more information.
